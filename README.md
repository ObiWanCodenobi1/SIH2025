# <ins>A MATLAB-based solution is needed to simplify realistic Indian road simulations and enable better traffic planning and research.</ins>

### Indian urban traffic modeling struggles because current tools donâ€™t capture real-world road challenges such as potholes, barricades, and erratic driving patterns. Existing approaches to creating digital twins are manual, slow, and lack realism.

##  <ins>Our Solution</ins>

We are developing a **MATLAB Library** for realistic Indian road simulation with the following features:

### Asset Library

* 3D potholes, barricades, and roadblocks

* Vehicles such as autorickshaws

* Authentic Indian road signs and textures

### Workflow Automation

* Custom MATLAB Toolbox functions for quick scenario creation:

    * addPothole â€“ Insert potholes on selected roads

    * generateIndianJunction â€“ Generate realistic Indian-style intersections

    * randomizeBarricades â€“ Place barricades dynamically for varied conditions

### Integration & Compatibility

* Works with MATLABâ€™s Driving Scenario Designer and RoadRunner

* Supports OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for geographically accurate environments

* Ensures high-fidelity modeling of Indiaâ€™s unique traffic conditions
