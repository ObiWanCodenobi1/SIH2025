# A MATLAB-based solution is needed to simplify realistic Indian road simulations and enable better traffic planning and research.

### Indian urban traffic modeling struggles because current tools don’t capture real-world road challenges such as potholes, barricades, and erratic driving patterns. Existing approaches to creating digital twins are manual, slow, and lack realism.

##  Our Solution

We are developing a MATLAB Library for realistic Indian road simulation with the following features:

### Asset Library

3D potholes, barricades, and roadblocks

Vehicles such as autorickshaws

Authentic Indian road signs and textures

### Workflow Automation

Custom MATLAB Toolbox functions for quick scenario creation:

addPothole – Insert potholes on selected roads

generateIndianJunction – Generate realistic Indian-style intersections

randomizeBarricades – Place barricades dynamically for varied conditions

### Integration & Compatibility

Works with MATLAB’s Driving Scenario Designer and RoadRunner

Supports OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for geographically accurate environments

Ensures high-fidelity modeling of India’s unique traffic conditions
